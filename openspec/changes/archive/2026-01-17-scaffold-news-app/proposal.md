# Proposal: Scaffold News Web App

## Goal
Create a single-page web application to display news from NewsAPI, adhering to the project's Angular/Bootstrap/Material tech stack. The application will allow users to view news headlines and filter by category.

## What Changes
- Scaffold Angular application structure.
- Implement NewsAPI integration service.
- Create a main news feed component with infinite scroll.
- Add category selection filter.
- Configure local storage for user settings (API key, preferences).

## Why
The user requested a single-page application to consume NewsAPI. This proposal aligns with the existing project context (Angular 17, client-side only) and sets up the foundational components.
