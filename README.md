# OpenNews Viewer

This project is a web application developed in Angular that consumes the **NewsAPI** to display news in real time. The main goal is to provide a simple, modern, and responsive interface for browsing and reading news articles from different sources.

It was created entirely with AI with the goal of testing the specification-driven development approach with **OpenSpec** `https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec`

The application allows users to navigate through recent news, view article details, and explore content organized by categories or topics, making use of the data provided by the NewsAPI.

## Features

Real-time news display via the NewsAPI

Responsive and intuitive user interface

List of articles including title, description, and image

Full article details when clicking on a news item

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
